# Playwright Test Analysis Report

## Test Run Summary
- **Date**: 2025-09-17
- **Total Tests**: 125
- **Passed**: 105
- **Failed**: 18
- **Skipped**: 2
- **Success Rate**: 84%

## Infrastructure Status
- **WASM App** (port 5225): ✅ Running and responding
- **Server App** (port 5224): ⚠️ Issues detected (HTTP 404 responses)
- **Test Focus**: WASM Chrome project only due to Server app issues

## Failed Test Categories

### 1. JavaScript Interop Tests (`base/interop.spec.js`)
**File**: `/home/connor/Photoswipe/Photoswipe.Blazor/tests/e2e/base/interop.spec.js`

**Failed Tests**:
- `should handle DOM element references correctly` (line 127-130)

**Root Cause**: Gallery images not loading - DOM selector `'a[data-pswp-width]'` returns 0 count instead of expected > 0

**Code Context**:
```javascript
const initialImageCount = await page.locator(testData.selectors.galleryImages).count();
expect(initialImageCount).toBeGreaterThan(0);
```

**Critical Impact**: This is a foundational failure - if gallery images aren't loading, most PhotoSwipe functionality cannot be tested.

### 2. Lightbox Functionality Tests (`base/lightbox.spec.js`)
**Failed Tests**: Multiple lightbox interaction tests

**Root Cause**: Same gallery loading issue - cannot open lightbox if gallery images aren't present

**Dependent Functionality**:
- Lightbox opening/closing
- Image navigation
- Keyboard controls
- Touch interactions

### 3. Upload Functionality Tests (`extensions/upload.spec.js`)
**Failed Tests**: File upload and gallery management tests

**Root Cause**: Upload gallery component not rendering properly or gallery images not being detected after upload

**Impact Areas**:
- Drag & drop functionality
- File input handling
- Upload preview
- Gallery state management after uploads

### 4. Selection Functionality Tests (`extensions/selection.spec.js`)
**Failed Tests**: Image selection and multi-selection tests

**Root Cause**: Selection overlay controls not functioning if base gallery isn't loaded

**Impact Areas**:
- Single image selection
- Multi-image selection
- Selection state management
- Selection UI indicators

### 5. Integration Tests (`extensions/integration.spec.js`)
**Failed Tests**: Cross-feature interaction tests

**Root Cause**: Cannot test feature combinations when base gallery functionality is broken

**Impact Areas**:
- Upload + Selection workflows
- Selection + Deletion workflows
- Complex user interaction patterns

## Primary Root Cause Analysis

### Core Issue: Gallery Images Not Loading
The fundamental problem appears to be that gallery images with the selector `'a[data-pswp-width]'` are not being rendered or detected in the WASM application.

**Potential Causes**:
1. **Component Rendering Issues**: PhotoSwipe gallery components may not be rendering properly in WASM
2. **Asset Loading Problems**: Required CSS/JS assets may not be loading correctly
3. **JavaScript Interop Failures**: Blazor WASM JavaScript interop may be failing
4. **Route/Page Issues**: Demo pages may not be loading the expected gallery content
5. **CSS Selector Changes**: The `data-pswp-width` attribute may not be applied correctly

### Test Data Configuration
**File**: `/home/connor/Photoswipe/Photoswipe.Blazor/tests/fixtures/test-data.js`

**Key Selector**: `galleryImages: 'a[data-pswp-width]'`

**URLs Being Tested**:
- `/` (home)
- `/basic-photoswipe-demo`
- `/extended-features-demo`
- `/vanilla-js-demo`

## Recommended Investigation Steps

### 1. Manual Verification
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5225/basic-photoswipe-demo
2. Inspect DOM to verify `a[data-pswp-width]` elements exist
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Verify PhotoSwipe CSS/JS assets are loading

### 2. Component Analysis
1. Review PhotoSwipe gallery component rendering in WASM context
2. Check if gallery data is being passed correctly to components
3. Verify JavaScript interop initialization

### 3. Asset Investigation
1. Confirm PhotoSwipe assets are properly bundled for WASM
2. Check _content/PhotoSwipe.Blazor/ asset paths
3. Verify CSS isolation is working correctly

### 4. Test Environment
1. Compare WASM vs Server app gallery rendering
2. Test with different browser configurations
3. Verify test data URLs are correct for current route structure

## Impact Assessment

### High Priority Fixes Needed
1. **Gallery Loading**: Must resolve gallery image detection issue
2. **Asset Loading**: Ensure all PhotoSwipe dependencies load in WASM
3. **Component Initialization**: Verify JavaScript interop setup

### Test Suite Health
- 84% pass rate indicates most infrastructure is working
- Concentrated failures suggest specific WASM-related issue
- Base functionality failure cascades to all advanced features

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Manual verification of WASM app gallery rendering
2. **Short-term**: Fix gallery loading issue and rerun tests
3. **Medium-term**: Verify test suite covers all refactored functionality
4. **Long-term**: Add test coverage for WASM-specific scenarios

## Test Cleanup Completed
- ✅ Deleted navigation tests (`setup/navigation.spec.js`) as requested
- ✅ Focused analysis on failing functionality tests
- ✅ Identified root cause pattern across all failure categories
